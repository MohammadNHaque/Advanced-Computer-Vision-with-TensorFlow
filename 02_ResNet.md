# Section 2: ResNet: Residual Learning for Image Recognition

In this section, we are going to learn about a new type of deep learning model called the ResNet model. Itâ€™s a type of residual learning for image recognition.

## Quiz
Now that you are done with the videos of section 2, let's assess your learning. Here, are a few questions; followed by 4 options, out of which 1 is the correct option. Select the right option and validate your learning!


The ResNet model was invented by which research team?
- [ ] OpenAI
- [ ] Google
- [x] Microsoft
- [ ] DeepMind

What does residual learning mean?
- [ ] Bottleneck block using 1x1 filters
- [x] Identity skip connect lets each layer learn the residual mapping
- [ ] Network only learns from correct predictions
- [ ] Squeezing and then expanding convolutional layers convolutional layers

What is the advantage of the bottleneck block design over regular convolutional layer stacking?
- [x] Similar complexity and better representation
- [ ] Training runs faster
- [ ] Blocks excess information down the network
- [ ] Avoids using 3x3 convolutional filters

What is the ResNet improvement proposed by the second paper discussed?
- [ ] Finish the residual block with a Batch Normalization layer
- [ ] Add a convolutional layer in the skip connection
- [ ] Remove the activation layer from the residual block
- [x] Apply pre-activation in the residual block\n
